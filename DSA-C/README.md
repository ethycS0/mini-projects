## C Data Structures Library

Welcome to the C Data Structures Library! This repository contains a collection of basic data structures implemented in C, intended for use in 2nd-year Data Structures classes or for anyone interested in learning about fundamental data structures.

### Overview

This library includes implementations of the following data structures:

1. **Linked List**: A fundamental data structure consisting of a sequence of elements where each element points to the next one.
2. **Stack**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end.
3. **Queue**: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
4. **Binary Tree**: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node has at most two children.
5. **Binary Search Tree**: A binary tree data structure in which each node has at most two children and the left child is less than the parent, and the right child is greater.
6. **Heap**: A specialized tree-based data structure in which the parent node is compared with its children and arranged accordingly.
7. **Hash Table**: A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, where keys are mapped to values using a hash function.
8. **Graph**: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect them.

### Usage

To use the data structures in your C projects, simply include the corresponding header file in your source code and link with the provided implementation file. Each data structure is implemented as a separate module, ensuring modularity and ease of use.

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions for improvements or new data structures to add, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Please ensure your code follows the existing coding style and includes appropriate documentation and test cases.

### Acknowledgements

This library was inspired by various resources and textbooks on data structures and algorithms. Special thanks to the authors and contributors of those materials for their valuable insights and implementations.

Happy coding!
