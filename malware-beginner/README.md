# Malware Development Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository dedicated to learning malware development techniques. Here, I document my journey as I explore various aspects of malware development, including shellcode injection, DLL injection, Win32 API, NTAPI, and soon to come, syscalls.

## Learning Resources

I primarily follow tutorials and guides from [Crow's Nest](https://www.crow.rip/crows-nest/mal/dev/getting-started) to gain a deeper understanding of these techniques. All credit for the tutorials and methods go to Croww.

## Techniques Explored

### Shellcode Injection

Shellcode injection involves injecting malicious code into a target process, typically to achieve stealthy execution or gain unauthorized access. I experiment with different methods of injecting shellcode and explore its applications in malware development.

### DLL Injection

DLL injection is a common technique used by malware to inject a dynamic link library (DLL) into the address space of a target process, allowing it to execute malicious code. I study various DLL injection methods and their implications for malware design.

### Win32 API

The Windows API, or Win32 API, provides a set of functions and interfaces for interacting with the Windows operating system. I delve into the Win32 API to understand how malware can leverage these functions to perform various tasks, such as file manipulation, process management, and network communication.

### NTAPI

The Native API (NTAPI) is a low-level interface used by the Windows operating system kernel. I explore the NTAPI to gain insights into system-level operations and investigate its potential for malware development.

## Future Endeavors

In addition to the techniques mentioned above, I plan to explore syscalls in the near future. Syscalls provide a direct interface to the operating system kernel and are essential for performing system-level operations. By understanding syscalls, I aim to further enhance my knowledge of malware development and its underlying mechanisms.

## Contributions

While this repository primarily serves as my personal learning space, I welcome contributions, feedback, and discussions from fellow enthusiasts and experts in the field. Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you have any suggestions, improvements, or insights to share.
