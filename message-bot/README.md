# Message-Bot

Message-Bot is a Python project developed in my free time to enhance my skills and understanding of Python programming. It allows you to send an unlimited number of identical messages to a specific person on various social media platforms. The script utilizes the Selenium library to automate browser actions, such as logging in and clicking buttons.

**Disclaimer:** I am not responsible for any misuse of this script. This project is purely for educational and recreational purposes. Please use it responsibly and at your own discretion. Note that using this script excessively or inappropriately may result in being banned from the respective social media platforms.
